# LineWaiter
Welcome to Line Waiter! With this web app, you can post a listing if you would like to pay someone to come wait in line for you (think those long food truck lines)! On the flip side, if you want to make some extra cash, come here for an easy, low-effort way to do so.

To set up the environment locally:
- clone and unzip the repository
- open in your preferred IDE (we used Pycharm)
- open the terminal, cd into LineWaiter\line-waiter
- run npm install
- open up another terminal to run the backend
- if Flask is not installed locally yet, run pip install Flask in the root directory
- the local environment is now set up

To run the web app locally:
- in one terminal, cd to the root directory (LineWaiter)
- flask run
- in another terminal, cd to line-waiter
- npm start
- a browser window will open with the webapp!
